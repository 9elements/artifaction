# Artifaction - NFT Landing Page

> Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)

## Local Setup

```shell
# On first run:
npx hardhat compile

# Install dependencies with yarn
yarn install

# Start local server
yarn dev
```

## Development

In order to keep the project tidy, we use stylelint and prettier. If you use VS Code, you can download [Stylelint for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint) and [Prettier vor VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

Ideally you should enable `editor.formatOnSave` in your settings to automatically beautify and fix template/style errors.

## Deployment

```shell
# Generate static files
yarn build
```

The static files are stored in the `dist` directory.

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
