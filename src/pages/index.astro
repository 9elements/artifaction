          A generative algorithm combines basic graphic shapes and pattern on a
          square area of 8 by 8 equally sized fields, according to a
          sophisticated scheme. Some elements occupy only one field, some have a
          size of 2 x 2, 2 x 3, 4 x 4 etc.. This creates patterns that are
          absolutely unique each time and there are endless possibilities. The
          mixture of filled and transparent elements creates an almost
          three-dimensional appearance. Sometimes it looks like you could walk
          into the object and hide behind a corner. Sometimes some of the
          smaller and finer elements repeating next to each other are creating a
          kind of digital glitch effects.

        <p>
          We are a free association of designers, creative coders and crypto
          nerds joining forces to develop visual projects and concepts right on
          the blockchain. We want to dive deeper into the crypto space and
          publish and promote our work on web 3.0 - just to make it a bit more
          beautiful and take design to the next level.
