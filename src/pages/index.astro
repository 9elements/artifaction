        Artifaction is a collaborative project in which designers and coders
        have joined forces to dive deeper into creative coding and the crypto
        space. We have developed generative artworks, which we call Artifacts.
        The artworks are stored immutably on the Ethereum Blockchain and a new
        pattern is generated with every click. Don't like it? Just click again â€“
        then the first one is lost forever, but the next one might be so
        beautiful that it could become your next tattoo.
